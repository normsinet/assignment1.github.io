    <h1>FUTURE JOB</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>The job that I want to do in future is Web Developer, so this is why I choose to study computer science. Front-end involves creating the user interface and user experience of a website, typically using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Back-end development focuses on server-side logic, databases, and server configuration, often using languages like Python, Ruby, PHP, or Node.js. Full-stack developers work on both the front-end and back-end.</p>
    <p>As a future Web Developer, I am excited to leverage my skills and passion for technology to create dynamic and user-centric digital experiences. In this role, I will focus on designing, developing, and maintaining websites and web applications that are both functional and aesthetically pleasing. My responsibilities will include writing clean, efficient code, integrating various web technologies, and ensuring that all sites are optimized for performance and responsiveness across different devices and browsers. I am eager to collaborate with cross-functional teams to gather requirements, solve complex problems, and implement innovative solutions that meet user needs and business objectives. Staying current with industry trends and emerging technologies will be crucial in adapting to the evolving web landscape, and I am committed to continuous learning and professional growth. My goal is to contribute to impactful projects that enhance user experiences and drive the success of the organization.</p>
