    <hr>
    <p>Actually, I change to Phnom Penh in 2020 but I but I'm not continue at that year I just only work. In 2022 I start study  at university in Computer Science major.</p>
    <p>As a university student, I am navigating a pivotal and exciting chapter of my academic journey. University life offers a rich blend of rigorous coursework, intellectual exploration, and personal growth. My days are filled with engaging lectures, collaborative group projects, and in-depth research that challenge me to think critically and expand my knowledge. Beyond academics, I actively participate in campus activities, from joining student organizations and attending networking events to exploring diverse cultural experiences. This environment fosters a sense of independence and responsibility, as I manage my time between studies, part-time work, and social life. University is also a time for self-discovery, where Iâ€™m honing my interests and career aspirations while building lasting relationships and connections. Each experience and opportunity helps shape my future, preparing me for the professional world and beyond, and making these years some of the most formative and enriching of my life.</p>
