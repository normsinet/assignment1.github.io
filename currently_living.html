    <hr>
    <p>I change to live in Phnom Penh since 2020. Phnom Penh is the capital of Cambodia.</p>
    <p>Phnom Penh, the capital of Cambodia, is a dynamic city that serves as the political, economic, and cultural heart of the country. Situated at the confluence of the Tonle Sap, Mekong, and Bassac rivers, Phnom Penh is known for its vibrant energy and rich history.</p>
    <p>Phnom Penh boasts a wealth of historical and cultural landmarks. The Royal Palace, with its stunning Khmer architecture and the Silver Pagoda, is a must-see, offering a glimpse into the opulent history of Cambodiaâ€™s monarchy. The National Museum of Cambodia, housed in a striking traditional building, showcases an impressive collection of Khmer art and artifacts.</p>
