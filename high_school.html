    <h1>HIGH SCHOOL</h1>
    <hr>
    <P>I study at Husen Wat Svay high school in Siem Reap city, I graduated in 2020.</P>
    <p>As a high school student, I’m in the midst of a transformative and dynamic phase of life, balancing academics, extracurricular activities, and personal growth. Each day is a mix of rigorous coursework, from advanced classes in subjects like mathematics and science to engaging discussions in the humanities. Beyond the classroom, I’m actively involved in various clubs and sports, which help me develop leadership skills and foster teamwork. High school is also a time of exploration and self-discovery, where I’m starting to identify my interests and passions, whether through participating in debate competitions, volunteering in community service, or pursuing creative projects. The friendships I build and the experiences I gather during these years are shaping my future and preparing me for the next steps in my academic and personal journey. Every challenge and achievement in high school contributes to a deeper understanding of who I am and who I aspire to become.</p>
